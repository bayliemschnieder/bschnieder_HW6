          Hi I'm Baylie Schnieder, I am currently studying business analytics
          and information systems at the University of Iowa. I am from Johnston,
          Iowa a suburb of Des Moines, Iowa. I've lived here my whole life
          basically, except I was born in Silvis, Illinois and lived there when
          I was baby. Most of my family is from Silvis or as many would say the
          greater Quad Cities area. So I often go there for holidays, birthday
          and trips visiting my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have one dog, one brother, and two nephews and nieces. Over the
          summer's I live with my parents and spend time often with them. Family
          is super important to me. I've played a lot of sports in my life and
          it ruled a big majority of my childhood. I used to play soccer all my
          life until I grew out of love for the sports after my freshmen of
          highschool. I still played it in highschool but it wasn't the same as
          it used to be for me. I also played volleyball, bowling and did the
          marching band where I did colorguard. I also did the band playing the
          clarinet during the off season of marching band.

          I am a avid concert goer, I have been to tons of concerts in the last couple years of my life. I have not enjoyed a concert.
          I've been to Lollapalooza 3 times now and this summer I won VIP!!!! It was a great experience, and I wanted to show a picture from that day.
